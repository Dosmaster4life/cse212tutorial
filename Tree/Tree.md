## What is a Binary Tree
A Binary Tree is a collections of nodes where each parent node has zero, one, or two children. A balanced binary tree with two children have the greater child on the right and the lesser child on the left. For example, a tree with a parent node of 10 would have a child of 2 on the left and a child of 11 on the right. Check out the [Diagrams](#Diagrams) for a visual.

- The Root Node is the node at the top of the tree
- The Parent Node is a node with children nodes
- The Child Node is a node with a parent
- The Leaf Node is a node without any children nodes

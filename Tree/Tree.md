## What is a Binary Tree
A Binary Tree is a collections of nodes where each parent node has zero, one, or two children. A balanced binary tree with two children have the greater child on the right and the lesser child on the left. For example, a tree with a parent node of 10 would have a child of 2 on the left and a child of 11 on the right. Check out the [Diagrams](#Diagrams) for a visual.

- The Root Node is the node at the top of the tree
- The Parent Node is a node with children nodes
- The Child Node is a node with a parent
- The Leaf Node is a node without any children nodes

Root Node: 7

Parent-child node relationships: 
7 has children 3 and 12
3 has children of 1 and 6
1 has children of 0 and 2
6 has 4 as a child
4 has 5 as a child
12 has children 9 and 13
9 has children 8 and 11
11 has 10 as a child
13 has 15 as as a child
15 has 14 as a child

Leaf Nodes: 0,2,5,8,10,14(Nodes without Children)

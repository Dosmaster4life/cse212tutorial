## What is a Set
A set is a data structure that allows you to save multiple items as a variable. A set has items that are unordered, without duplicates, and immutable. Sets allow you to add or remove items, but you are unable to change items. Sets can contain items of different types as well.


## Purpose of a Set
Sets are used to store items you do not want duplicates of, this can be useful when you are developing a variable that should never allow duplicates. Sets are faster than list, but are unordered. See the Code example to view all of the build in
in functions that can be used with sets.

## Set Performance

- .add(value) => O(1)
- .remove(value) => O(1)
- .union O(1)
- .intersection O(1)
- .difference O(n)
- accessing a set element O(n)
